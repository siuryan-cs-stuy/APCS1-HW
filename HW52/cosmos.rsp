Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Watching this video gave me a bit of an existential crisis, because you can't imagine how small you actually are in the universe until you realize that there isn't just the solar system and the Milky Way galaxy, but also an inifinite number of bubbles of galaxies.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
The scientific process is evidently important, and I like how the video pointed out that we have progressed more as a species over 300 years as a result of the scientific process than the other 200,000 years the human species has existed.

Didn't watch this one.

Response to
Episode 10 - "The Electric Boy"
@-------------------------------------------------
Although Faraday isn't as well known as other scientific geniuses, he deserves just as much recognition as they do. He started off with nothing, and through his hard work and determination, he was able to accomplish a lot. Much respect.
